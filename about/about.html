<h2>About me...</h2>
<p>
  Hi there! I'm Alex, a Full Stack Developer and entrepreneur.
  So let me give you the quick scoop before I bore you to death. I've always been
  interested in computers and software but I never really looked into it until one
  day I was asked if I could update an old attendance database.
  When I first sat down to look at the code nothing made sense to me. There were no comments 
  to help me make heads or tails of what it was doing. Even putting breakpoints didn't really
  help, since the code jumped around like crazy. So I decided to build a replacement
  instead. Since then, that database become my hobby and consumed all my free time.
  It was at that time I realized that I really enjoyed building things and I have
  been building things since.

<h2>Wait a minute...</h2>

  So how did databases lead me to Full Stack development? Well, the answer is The
  Odin Project. After spending so much time developing my little database, which
  at this point was running in three different computer labs and contained a suite of admin
  tools, I realized that I wanted to pursue this as my career but I had no idea
  how to do so. I eventually came across The Odin Project. I didn't know if I was
  going to enjoy building web apps, but I decided to take the plunge anyway.
  That was in February of 2018. When I started, my knowledge of web
  development topped out at building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Ever since, I have built
  full applications. Whether it be single page apps, RESTful web apps, to apps built with frameworks 
  and API's (Check out <a href="/projects">my projects</a>). Honestly, I couldn't be happier to have 
  learned all that I have and everyday I'm excited to build and learn new things.

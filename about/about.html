<h2>About me...</h2>
<p>
  Hello there! I'm Alex an aspiring Full Stack Developer and entrepreneur.
  So let me give you the quick scoop before I bore you to death. I've always been
  interested in computers and software but I never really looked into it until one
  day my boss at the time asked me if I could update an old attendance database.
  I thought it would be interesting so I said yes. When I first sat down to look
  at the code nothing made sense to me. There  were no comments to help me make
  heads or tails of what it was doing and even putting breakpoints didn't really
  help, since the code jumped around like crazy. So I decided to build a replacement
  instead. Since then, the database become my hobby and consumed all my free time.
  It was at that time I realized that I really enjoyed building things and I have
  been building things since.

  So how did databases lead me to Full Stack development? Well, the answer is The
  Odin Project. After spending so much time developing my little database, which
  at this point was running in three different labs and contained a suite of admin
  tools, I realized that I wanted to pursue this as my career but I had no idea
  how to do so. I eventually came across The Odin Project. I didn't know if I was
  going to enjoy building web apps, but I decided to take the plunge just for
  the experience; that was in February of 2018. When I started my knowledge of web
  development topped out at building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Now I can build
  full applications, from single page apps, to apps built with frameworks that connect
  to services like Firebase (Check out my <a href="/projects">projects</a>).
  Honestly, I couldn't be happier to have learned all
  that I have and everyday I'm excited to build and learn new things.
